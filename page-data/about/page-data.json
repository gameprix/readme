Non-uniform icons, too much content, too much images/gifs distracts visitors to see your actual work.</p>\n<p>To solve this, Github Profile README Generator came into existence.</p>\n<p>So many developers contributed to the project and made it more awesome to use. You can contribute too to make it grow even further.\n<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/issues/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator?style=flat-square\" alt=\"github-profile-readme-generator issues\"/> <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator?style=flat-square\" alt=\"github-profile-readme-generator pull-requests\"/>\n<br/><br/></p>\n<h2>How to use?</h2>\n<p>Tired of editing profile README(.md) to add new features like visitors-count badge, github-stats etc?</p>\n<p>Don't worry. Keep calm, fill the form and let the tool do the work for you</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator/master/src/images/github-profile-readme-generator.gif\"\nalt=\"github profile readme generator\" width=\"320\" /><br/><br/></p>\n<h2>Why visitors count keeps on increasing?</h2>\n<p>So many users raised an issue that the counter keeps on increasing everytime the page reloads.</p>\n<p>Well it is visitors count not \"unique\" visitors count. The goal of the addon is to provide a good stat of how well the github profile is doing.</p>\n<p>Proper use or misuse of the addon is the sole responsibility of the user. The developer of the addon is working on it to fix this issue.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 04, 2019","slug":"/about","title":"üë®‚Äçüíª About"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about"}}}
