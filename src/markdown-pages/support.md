Github Profile README Generator tool is free and will always be free. Numerous developers put their time and effort to make this tool more powerful. However, these developers are doing their full time job along with open-source contributions. 

You can come forward to support the developers by making small donations. You never know what will this support mean to them. Some will smile on seeing their work reward, some will be happy to pay the next month rent, some can buy coffee to contribute more.
